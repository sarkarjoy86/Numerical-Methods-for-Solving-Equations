# Numerical Methods

This project is designed to solve equations using different numerical methods, including both linear and non-linear methods. The project implements popular numerical techniques such as Gauss Elimination, Gauss-Jordan, Jacobi Iteration, Gauss-Seidel Iteration, and various methods for solving non-linear equations like Bisection, Regula Falsi, Newton-Raphson, and One-Point Iteration.

## Features

- **Linear Equations**: Solve systems of linear equations using different methods:
  - Gauss Elimination
  - Gauss-Jordan Elimination
  - Jacobi Iteration Method
  - Gauss-Seidel Iteration Method
- **Non-Linear Equations**: Solve non-linear equations using:
  - Bisection Method
  - Regula Falsi Method
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - One-Point Iteration Method

## Requirements

- **Compiler**: Any C++ compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
